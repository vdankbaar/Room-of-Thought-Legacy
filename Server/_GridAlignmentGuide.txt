Step 1: Use the align tool to get a ballpark for the settings
(Tip: for the following steps it can help to set a new grid colour)

Aligning the vertical lines:

Step 2: Scroll to the most left line on the pre-existing grid and compare it to the line on the new grid.
- Is the new line too far to left? Decrease Grid-x
- Is the new line too far to the right? Increase Grid-x
Change Grid-x in this way until the vertical lines on both the new grid and the pre-existing grid match exactly.
(If you have done this step correctly the line to the right should also almost be aligned)

Step 3: Scroll to the right side of the map and compare the vertical lines of the new grid with the lines of the pre-existing grid.
- Are the new lines slipping to the right? Increase Grid-x and add to X-offset to compensate so the left side of the map stays accurate.
- Are the new lines slipping to the left? Decrease Grid-x and subtract from X-offset to compensate so the left side of the map stays accurate.
Repeat this step until all the vertical lines match exactly.

Aligning the horizontal lines:

Step 4: Scroll up to the most top horizontal line on the pre-existing grid and compare it to the line on the new grid.
- Is the new line too far up? Decrease Grid-y
- Is the new line too far down? Increase Grid-y
Change Grid-y in this way until the lines match exactly.

Step 5: Scroll to the bottom of the map and compare the horizontal lines of the new grid with the lines of the pre-existing grid.
- Are the new lines too low? Increase Grid-y and add to Y-offset to compensate so the lines at the top of the map stay accurate.
- Are the new lines too high? Decrease Grid-y and subtract from Y-offset to compensate so the lines at the top of the map stay accurate.
Repeat this step until all the vertical lines match exactly.

When you have completed these steps the grids should match exactly.
